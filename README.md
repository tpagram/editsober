# Edit Sober
#### Hosted at https://tpagram.github.io/editsober

The most common piece of advice for writing is to separate the process of writing and editing. To first do a rough copy from your stream of consciousness and then edit it later. Edit Sober is a text editor that hides everything except the word you're currently typing. 
I find it useful to prevent myself from rereading my work as I type.
